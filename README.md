What do jQuery selectors start with?

Uhhhh, is it these things? (?

What's the problem with this code
in your html:
<div class="my-element">Hide me</div>
in your javascript:
$(".another-element").hide();

It needs a # thing to hide it??? IDK.

If you have a FOLDER named lib and a FILE named app.js, why won't this link to your javascript work?
<script src="app.js"></script>

It needs to be lib.app.js

What can you tell me about this: <input type="text"/> what is it? what will we be using them for?

It tells you what information type will be inputted.
